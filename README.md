# The result of test task for Data Engineering Internship

## Resources of my choice:
_Why did I use it in my project?_
* Flask 

_The practicality, simplicity and ease of using Flask which I had learned at University convinced me._
* Pandas

_I am working with_ Pandas _since I decided to develop my skills in data analysis. I am used to work with dataframes and I feel free to create my projects using them._

## Resolving the problem 'Step by step' :
1. Formatting and merging data from _02-src-data_ to single CSV file and then JSON file. 
2. Writing first scratches of an app in Flask with the required endpoints.
3. Loading JSON file to Minio to make it work locally.
4. Implementing filters. 
5. Creating Dockerfile and requirements.txt
6. Changes with pathnames.
7. Turning Minio credentials to become environment variables.
8. Having data uploaded periodically.
9. Adding run.sh
